# Where We Are

**Single source for "what's next" so any agent on any machine can answer correctly.**

- **Current phase:** Phase 3 (Developer Experience and Process)
- **Next item:** 28 — Add CI workflow (build + test on push/PR across major OS targets; include format/lint checks). Severity: High.
- **Last updated:** 2026-03-03

**Authority:** This file is a cached pointer. The **Status** column in `docs/status/CONSENSUS_PLAN.md` is the source of truth. When you complete an item: (1) mark it ✅ Done in CONSENSUS_PLAN.md, (2) update this file (next item = first row in CONSENSUS_PLAN not marked Done; update Last updated date). If this file and the plan disagree, the plan wins — fix this file.

**Rule for agents:** When the user asks "where are we" or "what's next", read this file and CONSENSUS_PLAN.md. Use the plan's Status column to confirm; if they disagree, update this file.

- Item 1–2: Loss sign convention fixed; `normalize_utility` accepts all loss params.
- Item 5: `test_loss_functions` added to build.
- Item 6: Dead `tests/CMakeLists.txt` and `examples/CMakeLists.txt` removed.
- Item 7: Eigen include line removed from CMake.
- Item 8: PRNG edge-case guards (`uniform_choice(0)`, `discrete_choice(empty)`, `beta` division-by-zero).
- Item 9: Minkowski `order_p >= 1` validation.
- Item 10: `lint.sh` find fix + `--strict` mode.
- Item 11: `make format` / `make lint` CMake targets; docs updated.

- Item 13: SIOF fix in `stream_manager.cpp` (Meyers' singleton).
- Item 14: Fixed seeds in tests (no `std::random_device`); relaxed ratio for high-p in `test_distance_speed`.
- Item 15: Error-condition tests (`EXPECT_THROW`) for invalid inputs across distance, loss, and PRNG functions.
- Item 16: Missing includes (`loss_functions.h`, `stream_manager.h`, `test_distance_speed.cpp`).
- Item 17: Unknown enum throws in `calculate_distance` and `distance_to_utility`; tests updated.
- Item 18: Single-owner StreamManager policy adopted and implemented. See `docs/architecture/StreamManager_Design.md`.
- Item 19: Tautological/empty tests fixed.
- Item 20: `beta_param` rename confirmed already done.

### Session: 2026-03-03 — Git/GitButler recovery; docs reorganization

- Removed GitButler. Git history was corrupted; files recovered from working tree.
- Reorganized docs into `docs/status/`, `docs/architecture/`, `docs/development/` subdirectories.
- Deleted duplicates (`agent_discussions/`), corrupted pre-recovery file, and empty stubs.
